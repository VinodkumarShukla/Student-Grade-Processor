# Student-Grade-Processor

Description:
The Student Grade Processor is a Python program designed to read student grade data from a file, determine the appropriate letter grades for each student, and then write the results to a new file. This program can handle an arbitrary number of student records and distinguish between graduate (GRAD) and undergraduate (UNDERGRAD) students, applying different grading rules accordingly.

Key Features:

Input Data Flexibility: The program can process grade data from files with varying numbers of student records, ensuring scalability and adaptability to different scenarios.
Data Parsing: The program reads each student's data, which includes the student type (GRAD or UNDERGRAD), the student's name, and the numerical grade.
Letter Grade Mapping: Based on the student type (graduate or undergraduate) and the numerical grade, the program determines the appropriate letter grade by applying specific grading rules.
Output File Generation: The program creates a new file to store the results, including the student's name, type, numerical grade, and letter grade.
Customizable Grading Rules: The program's grading rules are defined according to the assignment specifications, but they can be customized or extended to match specific educational institutions' grading criteria.
